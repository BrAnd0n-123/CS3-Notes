      <h1> Reviewer on HTML FORM </h1>
      
        <p> 
          Hello viewer! 
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided that instead of having written reviewers in GDocs, ComSci 
          specifically will have coded reviewers using OneCompiler. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of reviewer encourages the use of laptops or tablets, since 
          the viewport may be too small for phones. Ideally, you read both the code
          AND output. I hope this reviewer helps! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you and good luck in your studies! You can do this. 
        </p>
        
        
        <h2> HTML FORMS </h2>
        
        <p>
          
          How do websites get information? You are probably familiar with log-in or sign-up forms,
          and how we all hate them in some way. This uses <b>form</b>, allowing web applications to interact with users.
          
        </p>
        
        <h4> Basic form of Form </h4>
        
        <!-- CODE 1-->
        <pre>
        
            <form action="page.html"> 
                <input type="text" placeholder="See Code">
                <button> Submit </button>
            </form>
            
        </pre>
        
        
        <p>
          
          Form has some attributes that allow elements to be controlled and handled. Below are examples:
          
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li> action - sends the data to a page; can only act on one HTML page </li>
          
          <li> 
            method - specifies how data is sent through two ways: 
              <ul>
                <li> GET - non-sensitive data sent to URL </li>
                <li> POST - sensitive or large data sent to server </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li> autocomplete - controls browser suggestions to autofill inputs (on or off) </li>
          
          <li> name - provides a name to the form, similar to class and id </li>
          <li> disabled - </li>
          <li> novalidate - a bool attribute that disables automatic form validation when submitting </li>
          <li> target - specifices where response from server should be displayed </li>
        </ul>
        
      <p>
        
        
        
      </p>
