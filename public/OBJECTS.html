                <h1> Javascript Objects </h1>
                
                <p>
                    I'm sure everyone is familar what an object is- a non-primitive data type that stores data as key-value pairs. These key-value pairs are referred to as properties, and values that are functions are called methods. Properties represent related data of a group. For instance, a video game charater can have HP, LV, ATK, DEF and Gold.
                </p>
                
                <h2> Object Basic</h2>
                <p> 
                    To declare an object, use a variable declaration (usually const), followed by your object name, and "= {}". You would add all you key-value pairs in the curly brackets. 
                </p>
                <pre><code>const greatGatsby = {} //this is an empty object</code></pre>

                <p>You also probably know there are different ways to declare objects. The most basic is inline and object literals: </p>
                <pre><code>const greatGatsby = {narrator:"Nick Carraway"} </code></pre>
                <pre><code>const prideAndPrejudice = {
author: "Jane Austen", //Remember that in object literals, you must add commas at the end
couple: "Lizzy and Darcy"
}</code></pre>

            <section class="infoBox" id="cookies">
                <h2> Cookies </h2>
                <p> 
                    You probably encountered the word cookies while browsing. Sadly, they aren't actual biscuits you can snack on. Instead, they are small pieces of data that websites use to store information in your browser. They are sent back and forth between browser and server, allowing websites to remember preferences such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Login Status </li>
                        <li> Theme Preferences </li>
                        <li> Page Analytics </li>
                        <li> Session management </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p> 
                    If you don't want to be monitored by websites, you can disable cookies in you browser settings, or using Incognito mode. However, some websites may malfunction, prevent log-in, language settings, erase preferences, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other limitations of cookies include its small size (usually around 4KB), as well as being easily accessed by third parties, which can lead to privacy concerns. In addition, it is deleted when browsers are closed, or based on a set lifespan. Nevertheless, cookies are still useful in personalization and session management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, you can create, access and delete cookies using document.cookie. This property is a string of key-value pairs (ex. name1=value1; etc.). Below is a smaple of creating and accessing a cookie:
                </p>

                <pre> <code> document.cookie = "username=Gregor Mendel"; // Creates a cookie named "username" with value "Gregor Mendel" 
    console.log(document.cookie) //Output

    document.cookie = "username=Charles Darwin"; //Updates the "username" cookie to "Charles Darwin"

    document.cookie = "newUsername=Luois Pasteur; expires=Sat, 14 Feb 2026 12:00:00 UTC"; //Creates a cookie named "newUsername" with value "Louis Pasteur", that expires on February 14, 2026

    let x = document.cookie; //Access all cookies

    setCookie(Key,Value,Days)
    getCookie(Key)
    checkCookie() //Sample Functions</code> </pre>
